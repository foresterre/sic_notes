Can the Try operator be used with SignalCloak?

```rust
SignalCloakT<E> = Result<ContinueValue, SignalStopAndErrT<E>>
//with E is error type

SignalStopAndErrT<E> = Result<StopValue, E>

struct SignalCloakImpl {
    wrapper: SignalCloakT
}

struct SignalStopAndErrImpl {
    wrapper: SignalStopAndErrT
}

// And probably if possible, since docs note that it might be impossible,
// the reverse, for From<_>
// Docs also note that From is used by the Try (?) operator
//
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html
impl<E> Into<SignalCloakT<E>> for SignalCloakImpl<E> {
    
}

// idem
impl<E> Into<SignalStopAndErrT<E>> for SignalCloakStopAndErrImpl<E> {
    
}

// If not; should we switch to nightly for this?
// What are alternatives?
